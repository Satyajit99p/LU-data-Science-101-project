# LU-data-Science-101-project
An analytical study of the popular multiplayer video game Players Unknown BattleGrounds.

Datasetâ€™s columns Description:

groupId - Integer ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different
matches, they will have a different groupId each time.
matchId - Integer ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set .
assists - Number of enemy players this player damaged that were killed by teammates.
boosts - Number of boost items used.
damageDealt - Total damage dealt. Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.
DBNOs - Number of enemy players knocked.
headshotKills - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.
heals - Number of healing items used.
killPlace - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.
killPoints - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.)
kills - Number of enemy players killed.
killStreaks - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.
longestKill - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading,
as downing a - player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.
maxPlace - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as
sometimes the data skips over placements.
numGroups - Number of groups we have data for in the match.
revives - Number of times this player revived teammates.

rideDistance - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.
roadKills - Number of kills while in a vehicle.
swimDistance - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.
teamKills - Number of times this player killed a teammate.
vehicleDestroys - Number of vehicles destroyed.
walkDistance - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.
weaponsAcquired - Number of weapons picked up.
winPoints - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning
matters.)
winPlacePerc - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to
1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups,
so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match.
